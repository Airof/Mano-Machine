After finishing the project

1.I should reconstructing the Registers with generic so I only have one file and use the generic in order 
to change the size of the Registers


2.I shoud make packages instead of components

3. I should check if I can convers any signal to record for cleaning my code


4. making my port maps better
4.1 using generic map
      clk_gen : clk_generator
    generic map (CLK_PERIOD => 1 ns)  -- Optional: Custom period
    port map (clk => my_clk);
